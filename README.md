# take-control-1

# TAKE CONTROL - My first Javascript project here at UCD Professional Academy.

### Introduction: Kevin Corcoran
I have done little bits of coding before and enjoyed it but have really enjoyed the challenges of this course. 
It has pushed me to out of my comfort zone and showed me what I'm capable of, I'm far from the finished article but 
hope that time will help me fill in the gaps.

## The Strategy Plane

### Website Objectives

**Who's our target demographic:**   
Anybody who needs motivation to get themselves out of a dark or negative mindset and start making positive life changes.

**What's the value:**

The value is is to show people that simple steps towards positive changes can impact their lives.

## The Scope Plane

### Requirements and Functional Specifications

**Owner Goals**
   - Make the webiste easy to navigate and use across all devices and screen sizes
   - To get right to the point on the landing page.
   - Use images, icons and quotes to make the users relate
   - Have social media links on the footer of each page for easy access to contact us
   - Have a responsive sign up form with the ability to see errors and submit

**First-time/Repeat User Goals**
   - To encourage others to become more motivated and take control of their lives by beating procrastination.
   - Have the ability contact me now through the form or contact me via social media for further information or advice.
   - To be encouraged through simple quotes, videos and relatable images.

## The Structure Plane

### **Interaction Design**
   - **Consistent:** I tried to be consistent with the colors used, the layout of headings (navigation bar appears horizontally) and footers
   - **Predictable:** The layout consistency makes it predcictable how the next page should look
   - **Learnable:** Its predictability and simple navigation makes it easy to learn
   - **Visible:** Everything is clearly visible due to the mixture of colors and layout
   - **Feedback:** The form and to-do list have validations and errors to identity the issues or successes.

### **Information Archictecture**
The layout of the website was structured to proviude a user-friendly experience by allowing the user to move through the website freely and not get lost along the way. The header with has the navigation bar and the footer has the social media links to ensure this also.

## The Skeleton Plane
I wanted the webiste to be structured in the most user-friendly way by add the right content in the right places. My hope would be that each page would be enough to have the user move to the next one.

The navigation was to be placed at the top of the page and the contact us area (social media links) on the footer of each page so that the user would find information on either end as they finish scrolling. Tha landing page had some nice visuals such as images and a video to give a clear understanding of what the site was and what it stood for.

## The Surface Plane

The surface and finshed look of the website is consistent across key areas. The color, color-contrast, layout, fonts and patterns are all examples of the consistency shown on the surface to the user providing a pleasing experience to the user. 

# Issues and Troubleshooting

The "Home" page did not load as quickly as I wanted but it's not too slow either . 

I was unfortunately not able to make all the media queries perfect but hopefully I will get better with more experience.
